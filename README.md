# Progression App Data Converter
Analyse data exports from the Progression Workout Tracker Android app.

1. Retrieve your 'fws.json' file from `Android > data > workout.progression` and then transfer it to the repository directory.

2. Run the 'read_data.py' file to obtain a CSV file of the data

[The Jupyter notebook](example_analysis.ipynb) provides a starting point for analysis of the output file.
